# AutoCare-Tracker
Android vehicle maintenance tracking app

## Project Overview
AutoCare Tracker is an Android mobile application developed using Java. The app allows users to track and manage routine car and motorcycle maintenance tasks by storing service records digitally on the device.

## Problem Addressing
Vehicle maintenance is commonly tracked using paper logs or receipts, which are easy to lose and difficult to organize. AutoCare Tracker eliminates the need for paper maintenance logs by providing a centralized digital record that is always accessible on the user’s Android device.
